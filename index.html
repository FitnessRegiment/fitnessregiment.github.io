<h2>Welcome to my personal site</h2>
  
<p>Here you can find all my projects, blog posts, social media and my updated resume. You can also contact me below.</p>

<p>I will be posting irregularly as I find things to write about. I write guides, tutorials on random subjects I enjoy, primarily for myself but also to help others.</p><h3>A little bit about me:</h3><p>I am an undergraduate student studying Mathematics &amp; Physics, I love technology and learning about how the world works. I also love to share my interests and knowledge with others, thus the blog.&nbsp;</p>
