title: Essential Softwares for Windows
---


As a windows user we have thousands upon thousands of applications available to you. It can be hard to figure out what to use and which is best. In this blog post I will write about all the applications I highly recommend anyone to use. There are always alternative and I apologize if I don't mention your own favorite.

Core Applications:

* [Malwarebytes Anti-Virus (use free version, turn off all premium settings)](https://www.malwarebytes.com/)

* [7zip (Opensource compression software)](http://www.7-zip.org/)

* [VLC (Media player, plays everything!)](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-windows.en-GB.html)

* [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/index.html) with [Ublock Origin extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en)

Comfort:

* [F.lux (blue lights filter so you can comfortable read at night)](https://justgetflux.com/)

Security:

* [Hitman Pro 3](https://www.hitmanpro.com/en-us/hmp.aspx) (antivirus you should run on every new install or weekly)

You should also install a [VPN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network) (virtual private network) that hides your traffic to protect your identity and your data.

Another important type of security is protecting yourself from a data failure. This could be from a broken hard-drive or a stolen laptop. The simple ways of doing this is paying for [google drive](https://www.google.com/drive/), or [dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/) and setting up a good backup plan. I will be writing a separate blog post on data handling and data security soon with more information.
